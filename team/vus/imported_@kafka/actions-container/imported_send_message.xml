    <description>Send a Kafka Message to a topic.
More information on all the available parameters : https://kafka.apache.org/0102/documentation/#producerconfigs

Possible parameters are:&#xd;
- bootstrap.servers (required): A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster such as host1:port1,host2:port2.&#xd;
- topic (required): The topic the record will be appended to.&#xd;
- key (optional): The key that will be included in the record.&#xd;
- value (required): The record contents&#xd;
- headers (optional): Headers that will be included in the record. Format is the following: 'Key=Value,Key=Value'. Delimiters '=' and ',' can be escaped using '\' if present in either key or value&#xd;
- key.serializer (optional): Serializer class for key that implements the Serializer interface. Default value is "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer".&#xd;
- value.serializer (optional): Serializer class for value that implements the Serializer interface. Default value is "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer".&#xd;
- schema.registry.url (optional): Comma-separated list of URLs for schema registry instances that can be used to register or look up schemas.&#xd;
- key.schema (optional): The name of the AVRO schema to use to serialize the key&#xd;
- value.schema (optional): The name of the AVRO schema to use to serialize the message&#xd;
- close (optional): Whether to close the producer or not after sending the message. If not closed, the producer will be kept in the context for the next execution Default value is "false".&#xd;
- acks (optional): The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are allowed:
	- acks=0 If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the retries configuration will not take effect (as the client won't generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1.
	- acks=1 This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.
	- acks=all This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. This is equivalent to the acks=-1 setting. Default value is "1".&#xd;
- retries (optional): Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting max.in.flight.requests.per.connection to 1 will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first. Default value is "0".&#xd;
- buffer.memory (optional): The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will block for max.block.ms after which it will throw an exception. This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer will use, but is not a hard bound since not all memory the producer uses is used for buffering. Some additional memory will be used for compression (if compression is enabled) as well as for maintaining in-flight requests. Default value is "33554432".&#xd;
- batch.size (optional): The producer will attempt to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes.&#xd;
- client.id (optional): An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side request logging.&#xd;
- max.block.ms (optional): The configuration controls how long KafkaProducer.send() and KafkaProducer.partitionsFor() will block.These methods can be blocked either because the buffer is full or metadata unavailable.Blocking in the user-supplied serializers or partitioner will not be counted against this timeout.&#xd;
- compression.type (optional): The compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is none (i.e. no compression). Valid values are none, gzip, snappy, lz4, or zstd. Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better compression).&#xd;
- enable.idempotence (optional): When set to 'true', the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If 'false', producer retries due to broker failures, etc., may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Note that enabling idempotence requires max.in.flight.requests.per.connection to be less than or equal to 5, retries to be greater than 0 and acks must be 'all'. If these values are not explicitly set by the user, suitable values will be chosen. If incompatible values are set, a ConfigException will be thrown.&#xd;
- request.timeout.ms (optional): The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are exhausted. This should be larger than replica.lag.time.max.ms (a broker configuration) to reduce the possibility of message duplication due to unnecessary producer retries..</description>
